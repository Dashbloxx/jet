# jet
Jet is the ultimate python script for gathering information using an IP address. It uses plenty of different APIs to gather information, and if the APIs don't work, then it will skip and use a different API until it gets the information it needs.
## Usage
It is very easy to use this python script. Simply open up a terminal at the same directory level as the python script, and enter the command:
```
python3 jet.py <ip-address>
```
Replace `<ip-address>` with the IP address you desire to input. It will return information of the IP address you chose...
